While our community is always welcome to contribute, please note that
new feature development happens outside of this repo which means that 
open issues/PRs might not see a lot of activity. We do this in order to
make sure that all code that is pushed here has passed our rigorous QA 
testing and high security standards. That being said, weâ€™ll do our best 
to take note of feature requests or additions  some of which we might 
potentially incorporate into our codebase via our main development pipeline.
